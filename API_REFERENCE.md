## Waitlist System Behavior

### Automatic Promotion
When a confirmed booking is canceled:
1. System immediately promotes the next person in waitlist (lowest position number)
2. Status changes from `WAITLISTED` to `ConfirmationPending`
3. User has **10 seconds** to confirm using `/confirm` endpoint
4. If not confirmed within 10 seconds, booking moves back to end of waitlist
5. Next person in line is automatically promoted

### Sequential Processing
- Multiple simultaneous cancellations are processed sequentially by RabbitMQ
- Each cancellation promotes exactly one person from waitlist
- No race conditions or double-promotions occur

### Conference Start Cleanup
- When conference start time arrives, all waitlisted bookings are automatically canceled
- Conference-specific queues are cleaned up

## Validation Rules

### User ID
- Must be alphanumeric only (no spaces or special characters)
- Must be unique across system

### Conference Name
- Must be alphanumeric with spaces allowed
- Must be unique across system

### Topics
- Must be alphanumeric with spaces allowed
- Users: 1-50 topics required
- Conferences: 1-10 topics required

### Timestamps
- Must use format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
- Conference start must be in the future
- Conference end must be after start

### Business Rules
- Cannot book conference that has already started
- Cannot have overlapping confirmed bookings
- Booking same conference twice is prevented
- Waitlist positions are automatically managed

## Error Response Format
All error responses follow this format:
```json
{
    "message": "Descriptive error message"
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid input, business rule violation
- `404 Not Found` - Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server error
